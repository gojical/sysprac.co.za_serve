          <p class="card-text">Developed from International best practices and standards, ISO 45001 provides for the establishment of a framework supported by mandatory disciplines to ensure you have a functional and sustainable system which
            addresses health and safety requirements in your organisation.<br><br>

            The primary function of this system is to identify health and safety risks and to drive down those risks and exposures, which if not addressed, will result in a negative impact on the organisations business activities.<br><br>

            Applying the requirements of ISO 45001 creates a structured capacity to address the legal requirements as imposed on the employer and the employee in addition to which the Occupational Health and Safety Management System regulates the
            conduct of both employer and employee, thus ensuring the employers responsibility of creating a healthy and safe working environment is achieved.
