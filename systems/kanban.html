          <p class="card-text">Our Intelligent Process System (IPS) product is typically used in just-in-time manufacturing processes to order production inputs and schedule manufacturing at the time a customer places an order. By basing purchase
            orders and manufacturing schedules on actual, rather than anticipated, orders, pull-through production helps control inventory costs.<br><br>
            Pull-through production also facilitates product customization. Since products are made as they are ordered, it may be possible to cost-effectively tailor an order to a customer's specific needs, instead of only offering a generic
            product.
